== Report Your Stolen Bike

Last week someone stole my bike at the front of my building in Vancouver, BC. It is very frustrating to wake up to work and notice that your mean of transportation has gone. I didn't want to over react and ultimately I always try to take an stoic approach to these situations. 

However, I tried to find on the Internet a place to report stolen bikes and I couldn't find one. I thought that it might be useful to have place where people report this kinds of events, and who knows, someone might find the bike... 

So I decided to create a small system for this purpose. The site is live (hosted in heroku) in the following url: http://www.report-your-stolen-bike.com).

I hope that someone might find this useful.
