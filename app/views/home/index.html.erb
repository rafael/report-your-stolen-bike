      <h2> What is this all about? </h2> 
      <p> Well, my name is <%= link_to 'Rafael ChacÃ³n', 'http://www.rafael-chacon.com', :target => "_blank" %>  and my bike got stolen on July 31 2012.
      I was trying to find an easy way to report stolen bikes on the internet and I couldn't find it.
      So here is an attempt to propose a solution to that problem. Through this site you could report or check if a bike was stolen very easily.</p>
